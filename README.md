This project involves the development of a text editor using .NET Windows Forms, a feature of the .NET framework specifically tailored for creating rich client applications for the Windows environment. The text editor, designed to be lightweight and user-friendly, offers basic functionalities akin to traditional text editing software, making it suitable for handling plain text files.

Key Features:

Text Manipulation: Enables basic text operations such as input, editing, copying, cutting, pasting, and text selection.
File Operations: Supports opening, editing, and saving text files. The application will handle common text file formats like .txt.
Formatting Tools: Though primarily focused on plain text, basic formatting options such as font type, size, and color adjustments are included.
User Interface: A straightforward and intuitive interface, leveraging the capabilities of Windows Forms to provide a responsive and accessible user experience.
Undo/Redo Functionality: Basic undo and redo capabilities for text editing.
Search Functionality: Incorporates a simple search feature to find and highlight text within the document.
The project is structured to demonstrate the use of .NET Windows Forms for creating desktop applications. It serves as an excellent starting point for those looking to understand the fundamentals of desktop application development in the .NET ecosystem. The text editor, while basic, is scalable and can be expanded with additional features such as syntax highlighting, rich text formatting, and more advanced file operations.
